## Features

Riverboat plays No-limit Texas Hold'em. It's a full-service game-management library including:

- **Illegal move rejection** - disallows illegal plays, including moves out of turn, or raises that don't meet the minimum
- **Information hiding** - calculates exactly what any player can see at any moment, including edge cases like when all players are all-in
- **Winner determination and pot allocation** - correctly allocates pots at the end, including arbitrary numbers of sidepots and splits
- **Configurable** - buy-in limits and blinds can be set on a game-by-game basis

Riverboat also includes an evaluation submodule, which as of July 2020 is the *[fastest](./eval#benchmarks)* 5-, 6-, and 7-card poker hand evaluator in Go on Github.


## How-To

### Installation

To install:

```shell
$ go get github.com/alexclewontin/riverboat
```

To use in your project:

```go
import (
    // For the base library:
    "github.com/alexclewontin/riverboat"

    // For direct access to the hand evaluation module:
    "github.com/alexclewontin/riverboat/eval"
)
```

### Usage

Create a game:
```go
    g := riverboat.NewGame()
```

Add players, buy-in, ready up:
```go
    pNum := g.AddPlayer()

    err = riverboat.BuyIn(g, pNum, 1000)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    err = riverboat.ToggleReady(g, pNum, 0)
    // ... check for error
```

Play:

```go
    err = riverboat.Deal(g, pNum, 0)
    // ... check for error
    err = riverboat.Bet(g, pNum, 25)
    // ... check for error
    err = riverboat.Fold(g, pNum, 0)
    // ... check for error
```

Inspect the game's state:

```go
    // This doesn't contain opponents' cards, or the contents of the deck
    playerView := g.GenerateView(pNum)

    // This is the entire game state, for easy serialization and storage in a persistence layer
    godView := g.GenerateOmniView(pNum)
```
