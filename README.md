## Features

Riverboat plays No-limit Texas Hold'em. It's a full-service game-management library including:

- **Illegal move rejection** - disallows illegal plays, including moves out of turn, or raises that don't meet the minimum
- **Information hiding** - calculates exactly what any player can see at any moment, including edge cases like when all players are all-in
- **Winner determination and pot allocation** - correctly allocates pots at the end, including arbitrary numbers of sidepots and splits
- **Configurable** - buy-in limits and blinds can be set on a game-by-game basis

Riverboat also includes an evaluation submodule, which as of July 2020 is the *[fastest](./eval#benchmarks)* 5-, 6-, and 7-card poker hand evaluator in Go on Github.


## How-To
